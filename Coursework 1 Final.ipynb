    "### Code Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python code is designed to answer Question 1 of the coursework. The objective is to determine the most frequently assigned rating score and find out how many entries in the dataset have that rating score. The code reads data from 'ratings.csv' and counts the occurrences of each rating.\n",

    "### Code Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Processing**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - The code initializes a dictionary, 'rating_counts', to store the counts of each rating from the ratings file.\n",

    "2. **Read and Count Ratings**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It reads the data from 'ratings.csv' and counts the occurrences of each rating. For each rating, it increments the count in the rating_counts dictionary.\n",

    "## Question 2: Producing Statistics of Languages for Movies Released in a Specific Year\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python code answers Question 2 of the coursework. It aims to produce statistics of languages for movies released in a specific year. The code prompts the user to input a year, reads movie data from 'movies.json', and counts the occurrences of languages in movies released in that year.\n",

    "### Code Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**:\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "2. **User Input (Year)**:\n",

    "    - Instead of using `input()` to prompt the user for a year, this code directly assigns the year '1995' to the `year` variable. You can uncomment the `input()` line to enable user input if desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Read and Process Movie Data**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The code reads movie data from 'movies.json' and checks if each movie's release year (extracted from the 'releasedate' field) matches the specified year ('1995' in this case).

    "\n",

    "## Question 6: Identifying Top-Rated Movies by Passionate Users\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided Python code answers Question 6 of the coursework. The objective is to identify users passionate about a particular genre and find the top 5 highest-rated movies (on average) among those that received at least 3 ratings from these passionate users. The code reads data from 'movies.json' and 'ratings.csv', filters users passionate about the specified genre, and calculates the average ratings for movies they've rated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition**:\n",
    "   - `passion_project(genre)`: This function takes a genre as input, identifies passionate users and top-rated movies within that genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Filter Movies by Genre**:\n",
    "   - The code reads movie data from 'movies.json' and filters movies based on the specified genre. It collects movie titles in the `movie_id_to_title` dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Identify Passionate Users**:\n",
    "   - The code reads rating data from 'ratings.csv' and identifies users who have rated at least 10 movies in the specified genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate Average Ratings**:\n",
    "   - After identifying passionate users, the code calculates the average ratings for movies within the specified genre and stores them in the `movie_ratings` dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Sort and Return Top Movies**:\n",
    "   - The code sorts the list of average ratings in descending order and returns the top 5 movies along with their titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the top 5 movies in the 'Action' genre with the highest average ratings among passionate users, call the `passion_project('Action')` function. The code then prints the titles and average ratings of these movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "When executed, the code produces a list of the top 5 movies within the specified genre, ranked by their average ratings among passionate users.\n"
